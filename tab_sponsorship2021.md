## Developer Security Summit 2021 **[SPONSORSHIP DOCUMENT]** 

Date : 24th July, 2021

**OWASP AppSec Days Developer Security Summit 2021**

**What is OWASP**

The Open Web Application Security Project<sup>®</sup> (OWASP) is a
non-profit foundation that works to improve the security of software.
Through community-led open-source software projects, hundreds of local
chapters worldwide, tens of thousands of members, and leading
educational and training conferences, the OWASP Foundation is the source
for developers and technologists to secure the web.

-   Tools and Resources

-   Community and Networking

-   Education & Training

For nearly two decades corporations, foundations, developers, and
volunteers have supported the OWASP Foundation and its work.

While every OWASP Conference event is unique, here are some things that
don’t change:

-   The community organized, volunteer-driven, and sponsor funded

-   Provides a forum for expanding the spectrum of conversation

-   Focused on giving a voice to the “Next Big Thing”

**About Developer Security Summit 2021**

Developer Security Summit is part of the program for the developer
community and developer engagement program. We work with developers to
engage them with the security programs that OWASP currently has.

-   Project members will average the current projects catering to the
    developers.

-   Help developers based on different languages

-   Engage with the Outreach community to spread the word to the
    developers

**Summit Details**

**Date:** July 24, 2021 (Saturday)

**Venue:** Online

**Attendees:** Anyone

**Target Audience**

We target the developers, security professionals who work alongside
development teams, and anyone else interested in security looking to
offset or augment their current security skillset with that of the next
cutting-edge conversations. People who attend have various backgrounds
in different sectors and verticals. Their common goal is to learn about
emerging issues and connect with those who are having them.

This is our first year, we are projecting 200-500 attendees. Our
attendees are a mix of highly technical security people, mid-management,
and senior management along with a blend of students from local
universities and colleges.

**<u>Planned Activities</u>**

-   Talks

-   Panels

**Sponsorship Packages**

The goal of OWASP Foundation is to offer intimate events where all
participants can engage each other to help develop connections,
friendships, and network with different industry professionals. We
understand that every organization will have different goals and
priorities, which is why we offer different levels of participation for
every individual, group, or organization. We specifically designed
several different options for any sized organization to participate in
and support this event. **Should any sponsor feel, they can contribute
to the event in ways other than those listed in this kit, OWASP
Developer Summit 2021 encourages that organization to present the idea
as a custom sponsorship.**
